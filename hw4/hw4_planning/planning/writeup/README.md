**Q1.2** A* Shortest Path Figure: ![A*Shortest Path](Shortest_path.png)

**Q2.1** RRT Path Figure: ![RRT Path](RRT_path.png)

**Q3**

A* beats RRT Figure: ![A* beats RRT](a_star_beats_rrt.png)

A* is better than RRT because it finds the shortest path between the start and goal nodes

RRT beats A* Figure: ![RRT beats A*](rrt_beats_astar.png)

RRT is better than A* because it was more efficient (took less to implement map).

**Q5** A* heuristic design decisions: I found the max value of the minimum distance between -pi and pi
